The models, the MODELS. Models are everywhere. You're probably tired of hearing about models and are now tired of reading the word "model". I will attempt to explain why you should care about them, but even if you still don't care you will sound smarter afterwards.

## What is a Model?

A model is a replication of a thing or phenomenon. We make models of trains, cars, airplanes, which are smaller, physical replications of something much bigger. We know what something looks like at full scale, but a model is a smaller representation of that bigger thing. It allows us to see details or "big pictures" that we might not be able to otherwise see. For example, if you were standing on the dock next to the Titanic before it launched, you'd see a giant hunk of metal. You wouldn't see the grand staircase, the engine room, and all the people. However, if we made a *model* of the Titanic (you know the kind where you can take the top off), you'd be able to see much more detail! It would be a simplified version of a much bigger and complex thing.

In the case of a **mathematical model**, we are trying to take something that seems complex and explain it in a simple way with math. A great example is one you learned in grade school, the equation of a line. Bear with me, I know a line is simple, but it illustrates a point (no pun intended). You can draw a straight line on a piece of paper, but what if you needed to replicate the EXACT same line somewhere else? Freehand you couldn't do it with perfect precision, but with math you could. You need a way to *model* that line, so that you can use the model to replicate the same line over and over again, exactly the same way. The model just so happens to be: \\(y = ax + b\\). Just a side note, a **machine learning** model is basically a fancy mathematical model.

## Why does it matter?

No one builds a model for no reason. Well, I guess someone could, but I don't know anyone that would. You build models because you want something. If you're building a model train, you want a super cool train that you can show your friends and say "I built that!" Maybe you can even sell it for a profit once you build it. There is a return of joy and/or money when you're finished building the model.

If you're building a mathematical model, you want to learn something; you want to predict an event, number, replicate something, or simplify a complex system. Math is great at all of these things.

Let's go back to the line example. Suppose someone needs a line drawn, but they don't know exactly what it should look like. All they know is that it needs to point in a certain direction and be around a certain length. But you have a model of a line, remember? So you can take the approximate numbers they have and put them into your math model (another word for equation) and produce the perfect line. Easy!

Let's look at weather models (yes, these are mathematical models). Humans have collected mountains of data about the weather for the past few hundred years. But nobody really cares about weather in the past, we want to know about weather in the future! How can we predict the future? Let's say it together: *models*.

Think about what we're trying to do. Weather is a complicated system of atoms and molecules, and we just want to try and simplify it to something we can explain and use. We can use the massive amount of data about different variables such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, etc. to make a *model*, or replication, of the weather at a given point in time. Let's say tomorrow is June 1st. We can use the temperature from last year on June 1st and assume that it must be close, if not identical. So the model then becomes: \\(temp_{tomorrow} = temp_{thisDayLastYear}\\). Now the more variables we use, the more complex the model becomes. In reality, weather models are some of the most complex models in the world and require huge super computers to crunch all their numbers.

## But really, why does it matter?

Models drive so much of our daily lives. When you check the weather, get new suggested videos on YouTube, and listen to reports about the coronavirus, you are seeing the effects of modeling. Models are all around us, yet so many people think of them as abstracts. It's important to understand what makes our modern world tick.
