# The Science of Data
The blog dedicated to CMDA students at Virginia Tech, and all aspiring data scientists. Built with Jekyll, TailwindCSS, and coffee. Lots, and lots, of coffee.

## Stack
I love simple websites. There is nothing more beautiful than a simple UI and easy to understand tech stack. I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static website solution. (Ironically, the UI for Jekyll's site is not beautiful) The community and resources surrounding Jekyll are plentiful and thus would be easy to troubleshoot if I had any problems.

I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my CSS framework of choice. It's super easy, insanely fast, and when using [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) condenses down to the smallest CSS file size I have ever seen in a fully functioning website. I've used it on everything from tiny blogs to complex websites with 100+ pages.

As for my hosting platform, I choose none other than [Netlify](https://netlify.com). This is the greatest static hosting solution I have ever found. Try it out for yourself!

Oh and for the fancy particle effect on the homepage, I used the [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) package. It's easy to use and looks awesome.
